Nice work! Thanks for submitting this, but be sure to at least submit somthing for the 
other homeworks. Any submission, even a blank one, will get you a passing grade, but
some effort is always appreciated.

If you're having trouble or are overwhelmed with other aspects of the master's, don't
hesitate to let me know. I was there once too!

In any case, have a nice weekend and see you next week!
